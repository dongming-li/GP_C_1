##Description of Project:

Our project is a webapp designed to act as a lobby and meta tool for video game players to tracks their in-game stats, and track other players' stats. Players can interact with other players of all skill levels by creating "game lobbies" where other players can join, chat, and organize to play with them on a specified game of their choice. Users can follow other players, directly challenge players of all skill levels, seek practice with specific characters and game types, and discuss game meta with other players. There will also be tools available on the webapp for specific games to learn techniques and technical information about the game.

(As of right now we are keeping the "game" terminology non-specific, we originally planned on having it be a fighting game focused app, but if we can keep it template based we could branch off into other genres.)

##Project Outline:

The webapp itself will consist of an account based system where users, moderators, and admins can curate content together though our server. Users will have an account page where statistics can be calculated and analysis in game trends can be observed. Using an online database we will curate player data and account information. We will also implement a chat functionality and a hub for frame and character data. A forum for players to use, with preloaded templates available for posts, and where game related announcements will be present, and additional resources will also provided further explaining game specific "tech" or pertinent information.

##Large/Complex:

###Languages: Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is a new language for all of us
MySQL is new to all of us
Nobody has developed a web application or a database
There will be a back-end to develop as well as a front-end GUI.
Statistics and data-analysis in the back-end as well as statistics presentation in the front-end
Real-time user interaction through chat
The project has a lot of room to expand, so we need to make sure not to bite off more than we can chew
